        <p>
          I am a Data Scientist with a Ph.D. in Biochemistry, where my research focused on computational physics-based approaches to proteins and drug discovery. 
          In the course of my doctoral work, I developed Python-based workflows to automate complex analyses 
          and worked extensively with large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, often handling datasets of over 100,000 frames. 
          These experiences sharpened my ability to manage high-dimensional data and build efficient pipelines.<br><br>

          Building on this foundation, I am now pursuing a transition into data science, 
          expanding my skills through self-directed projects in machine learning. 
          By combining my scientific rigor with newly acquired ML knowledge, 
          I continue to develop predictive models and analytical tools that connect computational methods with practical insights.<br><br>

          Beyond technical skills, I take pride in being thorough, reliable, and eager to learn. 
          I approach challenges with both persistence and creativity, 
          motivated by the belief that thoughtful data science can drive meaningful scientific and real-world impact.
