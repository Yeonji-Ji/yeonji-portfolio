          Data Scientist with a Ph.D. in Biochemistry. Experienced in machine learning,
          statistical modeling, and large-scale data analysis. I build automated Python
          pipelines, develop predictive models, and analyze high-dimensional datasets
          from simulations and real-world data. Comfortable with Linux/HPC (Slurm), and
          tools like scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. Research background in
