        <p>
          I am a Data Scientist with a Ph.D. in Biochemistry, specializing in solving complex problems 
          by applying computational, data-driven approaches to drug discovery. In my doctoral research, 
          I built and deployed robust Python pipelines to analyze large-scale simulation datasets (>100,000 frames), 
          successfully translating high-dimensional data into actionable scientific insights. <br><br>

          Building on this analytical foundation, I have honed my expertise in machine learning through hands-on projects, 
          including building classification models for customer churn prediction and applying statistical inference in A/B testing.
          My unique strength lies in bridging the gap between rigorous scientific methodology and practical ML applications 
          to deliver reliable, data-driven solutions. <br><br>

          As a creative and persistent problem-solver, I am driven by the conviction that a thoughtful approach 
          to data science can uncover critical insights and create meaningful, real-world impact.
